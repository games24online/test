              neutrality.

              parties, or modify or disregard the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrators shall be bound by and

              <br>
              No action, regardless of form, arising out of or in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement,
              except
              for claims involving copyright, claims to recover outstanding amounts owed to Us, and claims for
              indemnification, may be brought by any party more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.

              All arbitration proceedings conducted under these Terms will be conducted on an individual basis; class

              Registration and International Transaction Fees; and Grant to Store Your Credit Card Number.
              (a) Subscription Fees. Certain services may require registration fees ("Subscription Fees"). These fees
              will be
              provided to you upon registration and may change from time to time. Unless otherwise indicated,
              Subscription
              Fees cover an initial period for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring periodic fees for
              subsequent periods as agreed upon during registration. You acknowledge that your subscription has an
              initial and
              recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.
              We may
              submit these previously authorized recurring charges (e.g., monthly) without further authorization from
              you
              until you have cancelled this authorization in accordance with your registration plan or wish to change
              your
              payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before we could reasonably act. To terminate
              your
              authorization or change your payment method for subscriptions, visit the Payment History page.
              <br>
              (b) Foreign Transaction Fees. We may use credit card processors or banks located outside of the United
              States to
              process your transactions. In some cases, your bank or credit card issuer may charge you a foreign
              transaction
              fee or similar charge. Prior to making any purchases, please consult your bank or credit card issuer for
              more
              information regarding its policies regarding foreign transactions and associated fees and charges.

              website,
              it is necessary for us (or our agents, e.g., credit card processors, payment gateways) to store your
              credit card
              number. Credit card numbers are stored in secure formats, including but not limited to encryption,

              this
              agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, and you agree to submit to the exclusive

              of these terms, including this section.

              You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and

              use of

              limited
              to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable
              provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent
              of
              the original provision, and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.
              <br>
              Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the individual
              and

            <p class="section__text text">
              In the event of a dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the parties agree to first attempt
              to
              resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution
              through
              direct negotiations, then, except as otherwise provided herein, either party may submit the dispute to
              binding
              arbitration in accordance with the applicable Arbitration Law. The scope of claims subject to arbitration
              ("Arbitral Claims") shall include, but is not limited to, contract and tort claims of all kinds, as well
              as
              claims based on any federal, state, or local law, regulation, or statute, except for claims by Us under
              applicable workers' compensation law, unemployment insurance claims, copyright claims (including claims
              involving copyrights, trademarks, patents, unfair competition, and trade secrets), and actions seeking
              injunctive relief, attachment, garnishment, or other equitable remedies. The arbitration shall take place
              in the
              Estonia, in a mutually agreed upon location, or if no agreement is reached, it shall be determined by the
              Mediator. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator who possesses expertise in Internet
              and
              ecommerce disputes. The mediator shall be willing to take an oath of neutrality.
              <br>
              The mediator shall not have the authority to award punitive or exemplary damages, certify a class action,
              add
              parties to the arbitration, or modify or disregard the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrators shall
              be
              bound by and apply Estonia law to any dispute submitted for arbitration, and this Agreement shall be
              interpreted
              in accordance with the laws of Estonia. The arbitrator shall provide a written opinion stating all
              material
              facts and the basis of their decision within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the arbitration
              proceedings.
              THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN REGARD TO ARBITRAL CLAIMS.
              <br>
              No waiver of the right to arbitration shall be effective unless it is provided affirmatively and in
              writing by
              the waiving party. There shall be no implied waiver of the right to arbitration. No acts, including the
              filing
              of lawsuits, shall be deemed a waiver or repudiation of the right to arbitrate.
              <br>
              Except for claims involving copyright, claims to recover amounts owed to Us, and claims for
              indemnification, no
              action, regardless of form, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought by any
              party
              more than one (1) year after the cause of action accrues.
